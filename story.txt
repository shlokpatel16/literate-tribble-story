Hello!
This is my story:

Once upon a time there was a furry bunny that loved to hide easter eggs. Even when it was not Easter, this bunny would still hide eggs. It became annoying to the townspeople because 
the bunny was wasting all the eggs. People had to wake up before work and search the city for an egg to cook themselves for breakfast. Eventually, people stopped eating eggs for breakfast and began to eat chicken instead.
